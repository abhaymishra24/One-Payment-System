### Project Description✍️

This is a one-payment system that allows users to make payments using a single payment application gateway for various transaction applications. The one-payment system includes all applications and enables users to make payments through any payment gateway. A single user ID will be connected to every payment system gateway.

### Objective✍️

-  Make payments easy with just one application through different payment gateways.
-  Try to keep only one application for users, so they don’t need to download multiple payment applications on their phones.
-  Add new upcoming payment transactions through one application for both online and offline services.
-  Create a single password for money transactions so that users will not forget it.
-  Even with this payment technology, if users want to keep multiple passwords for different payment gateways, they can do so without any issues
-  Create a single ID for the payment system so users don't need multiple IDs
