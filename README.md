### Project Description✍️

This is an application designed to check and compare prices and charges across different applications for many products. In this application, users can check the prices and charges of products from various applications using a single platform and choose to buy based on prices, charges, and product details. We will include product prices and summaries in this application. After selecting a product, users will be directed to the application where they want to make their purchase.
 
### Objective✍️

-  Make payments easy with just one application through different payment gateways.
-  Try to keep only one application for users, so they don’t need to download multiple payment applications on their phones.
-  Add new upcoming payment transactions through one application for both online and offline services.
-  Create a single password for money transactions so that users will not forget it.
-  Even with this payment technology, if users want to keep multiple passwords for different payment gateways, they can do so without any issues
-  Create a single ID for the payment system so users don't need multiple IDs
